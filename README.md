# Pizza_sales Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using MySQL for data querying and Microsoft Excel for dashboard visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from sales data, identify high-performing products, and understand customer purchase patterns.

# Dataset Used 


# üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL ‚Äì For data storage and advanced SQL queries
Microsoft Power BI ‚Äì For data visualization and dashboard creation
Power Query (Power BI) ‚Äì For data transformation (if used)
Pivot Tables & Charts ‚Äì For visual insights

# üîç Process Followed
1) Data Collection:
Pizza sales dataset imported into MySQL for structured storage and querying.

2) Data Cleaning & Preparation:
I) Removed null values and inconsistent entries.
II) Formatted dates, standardized categories.

3) Data Analysis (Using MySQL):
I) Performed SQL queries to: Calculate total revenue, order count, pizzas sold.
II) Identify best/worst-selling items.
III) Analyze trends by day/hour, size, and category.

5) Data Export:
Exported query results into Power BI for visualization.

6) Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
I) Used KPI's, Slicers, and Charts to create an interactive dashboard.
II) Highlighted KPIs and trends for clear storytelling.

7) Insight Extraction:
Interpreted data to generate business insights and conclusions.
